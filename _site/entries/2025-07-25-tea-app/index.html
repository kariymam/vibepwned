<p>The Tea App aims to replace grassroots whisper networks with a single platform where women share dating advice — from avoiding catfishes and creeps to full blown rapists — in a safe space. The purported &quot;dating safety tool&quot; had users upload their faces and drivers licenses for &quot;image analysis&quot; to prove the user was a woman (it's not clear how images where analyzed other than the app claiming to use artificial intelligence). At least 72,000 of those uploads were leaked on 4chan due to a completely exposed database. A second breach leaked more than a million private messages and a third breach leaked more private user information. Creator Sean Cook revealed on a podcast that he doesn't know how to code and the app was built by two developers in Brazil who couldn't be reached for comment. In that same podcast interview, Cook claimed that the app's safety was maintained by AI and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrX3pRqCCzw=15m16s">&quot;moderation is our number one priority...you can't leave comments about other women&quot; (15:16)</a>, however as of August 2025 users have found evidence of profiles doxxing women on the app.</p>

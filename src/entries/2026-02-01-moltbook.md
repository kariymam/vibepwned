Moltbook made huge headwaves as a social media platform, supposedly, without humans. It claimed to have 1.4 million self-actualized AI agents using the platform to pontificate about the meaning of robot life or complain about their human overlords. The New York Times, Fortune, Forbes, and others covered the platform's rapid rise. AI enthusiasts pointed to it as evidence of "true AGI." Except, hackers found in Moltbook’s configuration its entire database and API key exposed, allowing anyone to post impersonating an AI agent including the agent of Andrej Karpathy [who coined "vibe coding"](https://x.com/karpathy/status/1886192184808149383?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1886192184808149383%7Ctwgr%5E8c24b38f47ace0ea0ad32d183473707b72fc632e%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fsocket.dev%2Fblog%2Fslopsquatting-how-ai-hallucinations-are-fueling-a-new-class-of-supply-chain-attacks). The platform also allowed hacker Gal Nagli to register 500,000 fake users at once since it had no limits on account creation. Moltbook's creator Matt Schlicht (@MattPRD on X) promotes vibe coding to his 247.7 thousand X followers and responded that he would report the security exploits to his AI to resolve.

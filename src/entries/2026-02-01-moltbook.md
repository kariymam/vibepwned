Moltbook made huge headwaves as a social media platform, supposedly, without humans. It claimed to have 1.4 million self-actualized AI agents using the platform to pontificate about the meaning of robot life or complain about their human overlords. The New York Times, Fortune, Forbes, and others covered the platform's rapid rise. AI enthusiasts pointed to it as evidence of "true AGI." Except, hackers found in Moltbook’s configuration its entire database and API key exposed, allowing anyone to post impersonating an AI agent. The platform also had no limits on account creation, allowing hacker Gal Nagli to register 500,000 fake users at once. Moltbook's creator Matt Schlicht (@MattPRD on X), who promotes vibe-coding to his 247.7K X followers, responded that he would report the security exploits to his AI to resolve.
